                <h1>All you need to know about sweating and exercise</h1>
                <p>

                    Gyms are sweaty places. Whether you’re hitting the weights section or running on the treadmill,
                    you’ve likely had a few sessions where you’re dripping wet wondering whether something is wrong.
                    We’re here to explore just what normal means and to dispel some common myths and misconceptions
                    about the relationship between sweating and exercise.

                <h5>What happens when we sweat?</h5>
                <p>
                    Sweating is our body’s way of regulating temperature by releasing water through the sweat glands in
                    our skin. When the sweat on our skin evaporates, the body is cooled.

                    When we exercise, our body temperature increases because our heart rate goes up. This results in
                    more sweating because our body is fighting to keep our core temperature level.
                </p>

                <h5>What's sweat made from?</h5>
                <p>
                    Sweat is mostly made up of water. It also contains some chloride, sodium, magnesium, potassium, and
                    calcium.

                    Just like the amount, the contents of our sweat differs from person to person too. If you’re someone
                    who regularly finds sweat crystalising on their forehead, you’re losing a lot of sodium as you
                    perspire. Consider replenishing with a sports energy drink if this sounds familiar.

                <h5>Is sweat a good indicator of effort?</h5>
                <p>
                    Sweating is a very vague way of gauging whether you’ve had a good workout or not. It doesn’t utilise
                    any data and can be easily influenced by your environment.

                    Your genetics are also largely responsible for how much you sweat, meaning effort and perspiration
                    don’t necessarily correlate.

                    A better way to gauge the success of your workout is to use a heart rate monitor or similar device
                    to gauge your peak threshold. This metric (and other data driven performance devices) can be logged
                    and used to gauge progress over time instead of relying on sweating as a vague indicator of
                    performance.

                <h5>What happens when we sweat?</h5>
                <p>
                    Sweating is our body’s way of regulating temperature by releasing water through the sweat glands in
                    our skin. When the sweat on our skin evaporates, the body is cooled.

                    When we exercise, our body temperature increases because our heart rate goes up. This results in
                    more sweating because our body is fighting to keep our core temperature level.

                <h5>What is a normal amount to sweat?</h5>
                <p>
                    We can get caught up in comparing ourselves to others in the gym. Sweating is no different.

                    If you’re self-conscious about your perspiration levels, you might be looking around the gym
                    wondering if you’re on your own. The good news is, there is no “normal” amount to sweat.

                    Unfortunately, the biggest factor determining how much you sweat is genetics.
