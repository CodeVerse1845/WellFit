                <h1>Is changing your exercise routine worth it?</h1>
                <p>

                    When assessing your gym routine, you want to make sure you’re always seeing progression.

                    If you’ve noticed a plateau in your progress whilst training, or you’re starting to feel demotivated
                    - it may be time to change things up.

                    What this looks like will typically differ from person to person. Two of the most common indications
                    of progression are the ability to lift heavier weights or to perform more repetitions.

                    Wellbeing Personal Trainer Jamie Ramage believes “if you’re stalling on an exercise for three or
                    four consecutive sessions, this could be a sign that it's time to swap that exercise out for
                    something else”.
                </p>

                <h5>How often should I change routine?</h5>
                <p>
                    Training needs to be engaging and fun or we’ll quickly lose interest. Changing your routine can help
                    bring back that novelty you might have felt when you first started training.

                    Always keep your goal in mind -
                    Ultimately, when and how you change your routine all depends on what your goal is.

                    Griffin expands on this by saying “whilst there’s no specific timeframe for changing things up,
                    noticing that you aren’t progressing towards your goal can be a good indication that it’s time to
                    try something different”.

                    What this looks like will all depend on what your goal is (it could be running your first marathon,
                    losing weight, or getting stronger) and the type of training you prefer.
                </p>

                <h5>What about sticking with my routine? </h5>
                <p>Consistency is great and it helps us form healthy habits, however if your goal is to get fitter,
                    faster, stronger, or leaner - you will need to progress your plan in some way in order to see
                    results.
                    Being consistent with your overall routine whilst progressing each session is a great way to track
                    your progress and see the improvement you’re making.

                    It can be easy to put pressure on yourself to remain “consistent” and complete the exact same
                    exercise routine every week. However, life happens (think holidays, birthdays, illness, injury etc.)
                    and our exercise routine should be able to adapt to it. Whilst it’s important to stay consistent, a
                    certain degree of “go with the flow” is needed, whilst still allowing us to maintain our fitness or
                    progression.

                    Ramage adds that there’s nothing wrong with keeping things familiar if it works for you.

                    “As the saying goes, ‘if it ain’t broke, don't fix it’. If you're enjoying your training and
                    everything's moving in the right direction, then there’s really no pressing need to change things
                    up”.

                <h5>What about overtraining?</h5>
                <p>
                    Overtraining doesn't necessarily mean you need to change your whole routine, but you may want to
                    strip back the overall volume of your training for a short period.

                    As previously discussed, this could mean doing two full-body sessions per week instead of three, or
                    just performing two to three sets of exercises instead of your normal three or four.

                    You need to allow the body to recover properly, so stripping things back while making sure you're
                    getting adequate sleep and rest can have big benefits in the long run.

                <h5>How does routine help us mentally?</h5>
                <p>
                    Mental Health Prevention Lead Lisa Gunn confirms that developing good habitual behaviours and
                    routines is good for our mental health and productivity.

                    “A lot of the same rules apply when comes to exercise. Knowing how and when we’re going to exercise
                    can create healthy habit loops in our brain that help positive behaviours become more automatic and
                    easier to engage with”.
                </p>

                <h5>Taking a mental health break from exercise</h5>
                <p>
                    We often focus on the body and our muscles when considering whether or not to take a break from
                    exercise. It’s important to remember that the mind can become burned out on exercise in a similar
                    fashion.

                    Gunn continues by saying that there are benefits to taking a break from exercise whilst we
                    reevaluate our routine and relationship with working out.

                    “Physical burnout can cause fatigue and demotivation, causing our mental health to deteriorate
                    simultaneously. With this in mind, it’s important that we diversify our routine and make sure we’re
                    getting pleasure from several sources and activities away from exercise.

                    This way, if life gets in the way and we need to take a break from exercising regularly, we’re able
                    to maintain our mental health whilst the body takes a break”.
